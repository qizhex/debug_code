# NoisyStudent

## Overview

NoisyStudent is a semi-supervised learning method which achieves 88.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet (SOTA) and surprising gains on robustness and adversarial benchmarks.
NoisyStudent is based on the self-training framework and trained with 4 simple steps:
1. Train a classifier on labeled data (teacher).
2. Infer labels on a much larger unlabeled dataset.
3. Train a larger classifier on the combined set, adding noise (noisy student).
4. Go to step 2, with student as teacher

For ImageNet checkpoints trained by NoisyStudent, please refer to the [EfficientNet github](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/efficientnet#2-using-pretrained-efficientnet-checkpoints).

## SVHN Experiments
Our ImageNet experiments requires using JFT-300M which is not publicly
available. We will release the full code for ImageNet in a few weeks.

Here we show an implementation of NoisyStudent on SVHN, which boosts the performance of a
supervised model from 97.9% accuracy to 98.5% accuracy.

```shell
# Download and preprocess SVHN. Download the teacher model trained on labeled data with accuracy 97.9.
bash local_scripts/prepro.sh

# Training & Eval (expected accuracy: 98.6 +- 0.1)
bash local_scripts/run_svhn.sh
```

You can also use the colab script [noisystudent_svhn.ipynb](https://github.com/google-research/noisystudent/blob/master/noisystudent_svhn.ipynb) to try the method on free Colab GPUs.
